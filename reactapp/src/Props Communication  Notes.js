1. Three tenets of Components

a. Component nesting : a component can be shown
inside of another

b. Component Resuability :
create components that are resuable for the entire application

c. Component configuration:
components must be configurable
each component must be allowed to configured separately



2. important libraries

semantic ui
faker js


3. CREATING A REUSABLE CONFIGURABLE COMPONENT

A. identify the jsx that appears to be duplicated

B. what is the purpose of that block of jsx

C. create a new file to house this new component

D. make the new comp configurable byy using Reacts 'n-props' system.

4. To refer js Variables we use : {}

but to refer to React Components : we use <compName/>
