1. RULES OF STATE:

a. Only usable with class components

b. you will confuse props with state

c. 'state' is a JS object that contains
data relevant to a component

d. updating 'state' onn a comp
cause the comp to almost instantly
rerender

e. state must be initialized when a
component is createed

f. state can only be updated using 'setState' method

2. in a CBC,
a. constructor is the function
    that is called.
b. why super()?

as we know we always extend component class of react, containing n number
of functionalities,

thus super works as refreence to constructor of parents component(React.Component)
