    1. AXIOS VS FETCH
 

    FETCH is not actually a library but  is used frequently with
    react applications for managing network requessts and
    fetching some amount of data.
    fetch is actually a function supported by all the browsers
    However fetch is a far mor basic and lower level
    function used to fetchh data.
    If wee use fetch,we will hav to write a lot of code
    that is already written in axios packages


 
    Axios is a standalone third party package that can
    be installed using npm.
    easier to use
    shorter line of code

   2. handling requests
   
    whenever we make a request with axios,it returns
    an object called a promise, where a promise is a 
    object that gives us a little notification when
    some amount of work like n/w requested.
